My Implementation of a Simple MP1-like Compression Algorithm
I'm creating this for my glitch art pet projects.
Don't expect this algorithm to offer any high-quality audio compressionâ€”that's not what I'm after.
In fact, I want just the opposite: the worse the quality, the better.

To run tests:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
./quick_test.py
```
